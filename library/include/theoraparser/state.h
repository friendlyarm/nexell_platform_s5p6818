/*Super blocks are 32x32 segments of pixels in a single color plane indexed
in image order.
Internally, super blocks are broken up into four quadrants, each of which
contains a 2x2 pattern of blocks, each of which is an 8x8 block of pixels.
Quadrants, and the blocks within them, are indexed in a special order called
a "Hilbert curve" within the super block.

In order to differentiate between the Hilbert-curve indexing strategy and
the regular image order indexing strategy, blocks indexed in image order
are called "fragments".
Fragments are indexed in image order, left to right, then bottom to top,
from Y' plane to Cb plane to Cr plane.

The co-located fragments in all image planes corresponding to the location
of a single quadrant of a luma plane super block form a macro block.
Thus there is only a single set of macro blocks for all planes, each of which
contains between 6 and 12 fragments, depending on the pixel format.
Therefore macro block information is kept in a separate set of arrays from
super blocks to avoid unused space in the other planes.
The lists are indexed in super block order.
That is, the macro block corresponding to the macro block mbi in (luma plane)
super block sbi is at index (sbi<<2|mbi).
Thus the number of macro blocks in each dimension is always twice the number
of super blocks, even when only an odd number fall inside the coded frame.
These "extra" macro blocks are just an artifact of our internal data layout,
and not part of the coded stream; they are flagged with a negative MB mode.*/
